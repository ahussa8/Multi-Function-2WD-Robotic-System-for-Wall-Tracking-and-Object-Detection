## ‚öôÔ∏è Challenge Tasks

### üåÄ Challenge 1: U-Turn (Autonomous)
- Robot advanced 2 meters toward a wall
- Turned around autonomously at 30 cm from the wall
- Returned to start zone within 50 cm margin
- Used ultrasonic sensor for distance detection and timed braking logic

### üöß Challenge 2: Obstacle Course
**(Two Modes: Autonomous or Remote)**
- Used servo-mounted ultrasonic sensor to scan and steer
- Avoided static obstacles and navigated toward a goal zone
- Remote version used directional input for navigation

### üß± Challenge 3: Wall Following with PD (Autonomous)
- Used proportional‚Äìderivative control to maintain 30 cm distance from a wall
- Servo sweep provided angular distance feedback for directional correction

## üíª Software Structure
- Separate `.ino` sketches for each challenge
- Modular functions for movement control, sensor reading, and condition logic
- Servo scanning loop and distance logic integrated into PD controller and object tracker

## üß† Key Features
- Hybrid autonomous/manual design
- Real-time distance classification via servo sweeping
- Collision-safe wall following with PD tuning

## üß™ Testing & Evaluation
- Tested on multiple surfaces (tile, cardboard)
- Calibrated motor speeds and distances for consistent performance
- Debugged angle offsets and adjusted motor delay timing
